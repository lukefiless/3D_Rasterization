# 3D_Rasterization

This is a test of a 3D simulation, similar to what mine craft is.
It uses triangles to create every side and detect depth, distance, etc.

The program is optimized by not having back sides of object or covered sideds rendered. This causes a few visual bugs that still need to be worked. Out. Lighing also is not yet perfect, but am working to improve. A matrix representation of vectors detects the user's vision
